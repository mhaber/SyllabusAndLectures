## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the topic

- Introduce course motivation, goals, plan, and expectations/assessment

- Introduce collaborative & reproducible data analysis

- Setup computational research environment

## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the course

**Collaboratively** and **reproducibly**:

1. Gather and clean social data

2. Analyse it to draw informed descriptions/inferences

3. Present results in a variety of mediums

## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the course

<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> Learn how to actually **do** data analysis
using **best practices** <i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i>

We are going to use **ugly real-world data**, not pristine training data sets.

Use **advanced computational tools** to do **data munging**.

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: Academic

- Skills needed to do **original quantitative research** for your **thesis**.

    + The final project will be a **trial version** of your thesis.

- State-of-the-art tools needed for **future high-level academic research**.

    + Take advantage of new data sources.

    + Avoid effort duplication.

    + Make your research reproducible.

    + Present your results to multiple forums.

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: Government

Government agencies are increasingly adopting the technologies and methods
of open data science.

[<img src="img/GithubGovUse.png" align="center" height="400"/>](https://github.com/blog/1874-government-opens-up-10k-active-government-users-on-github)

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: Government

- Public data is increasingly **accessible**.

    + e.g. [World Bank Development Indicators](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators),
    [GovData Germany](https://www.govdata.de/neues), [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/),
    [New York City](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/),
    [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/)

- Governments rely on data analysis for evidence based decision-making.

    + Tools of open data analysis enable better use of data **within** and
    **between** government actors.

    + Governments can take advantage of analyses done by **third parties**.

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: Government

- They are also **sharing** and **collaboratively** developing code; **reducing
development costs** and **improving applications**.

- Example: version control to **increase engagement with the legislative process**.

    + [Forkable](https://github.com/SFMOCI/openlaw) [<i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i>](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) San Francisco laws.

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: NGO

NGO's are becoming increasingly data-oriented and need people with **skills** to
**handle and analyse** this data.

Ex. Former MPP-E1180 student Arndt Leininger recently co-founded
[CorrelAid](http://correlaid.org/) to assist NGOs with data analysis.

## <i class="fa fa-compass"></i> Motivation: Business

Data analysis and R programming skills in particular are **highly valued** in
businesses such as finance and management.

![[O'Reilly (2016)](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2016-data-science-salary-survey.pdf?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=revue)](img/RSalaries.png)

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why Collaborative?

- Research is collaborative (even if you don't know it).

- Need tools and shared best practices to enable effective collaboration between
**explicit research partners**.

- Need tools and shared best practices to enable collaboration between researchers
who are **not explicitly** working together often in **unexpected ways**.

    + **Avoids effort duplication**

    + Enables **cumulative knowledge development**

- Tools for collaboration tend to enhance **reproducibility**.

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What is reproducibility?

**Really reproducible** research (Peng 2011, 1226):

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> the data and code used to make a finding are
**available** and they are **sufficient** for an independent researcher to
**recreate the finding**. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

- In practice reproducibility is enhanced by **literate programming** where the data,
analysis, and presentation of the results are 'weaved' or 'knitted' together.

    + Make available the research, **not just the advertising** for the findings (e.g.
    papers, book).

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Reproducibility vs. Replication?

**Reproducibility**: an independent study makes the same findings using the
**same data** and **code** as the original researchers.

**Replicability**: an independent study makes the same conclusions as the original
using **other** data, code, and even methods,
i.e. independent verification.

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Reproducibility vs. Replication?

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **''A study can be reproducible and still
be wrong''** [Peng 2014](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/).

E.g. a finding that is statistically significant in one study may remain statistically
significant when reproduced using the original data/code, but **replication studies
are unable to find a similar result**.

The original finding could just have been
[noise](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/03/disagree-alan-turing-daniel-kahneman-regarding-strength-statistical-evidence/).

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why reproducibility?

- **Replication** is the ''**ultimate standard**'' for judging scientific claims (Peng 2011).

- **Reproducibility**

    + **Enhances replication** (other researchers can understand how an analysis
    was actually done)

    + Is a **minimum standard** for judging scientific claims when replication is
    not possible.

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why reproducibility?

Reproducibility helps **avoid effort duplication**:

- Others **don't waste time**:

    + Gathering data that has already been gathered.

    + Discovering procedures that have already been discovered.

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why reproducibility?

- Reproducibility also makes it possible to **find and correct errors**.

- Recent examples:
    - Translation errors in the
    [World Values Survey](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/02/world-values-lost-in-translation/).

    - Data errors in research on
    [intestinal worm treatment and school attendance](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/w/worms.html).

    - [L'Affaire LaCour](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630535/same-sex-marriage-study):
    data *fabrication* discovered.

- Data errors can cause spurious findings that ultimately **waste researchers time**,
because they try to explain 'wrong' findings.

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why reproducibility?

- **Higher research impact**

    + Reproducible research is likely to be more **useful for other researchers**.
    They can use your data and learn from your code and methods.

    + More use <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> more impact (e.g. citations)

- **Better work habits**

    + Thinking about reproducibility from the beginning makes your files
    **better organised** and your work is **better documented**.

    + This allows you to **build on your own work** more effectively.

## <i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Reproducible Workflow

[<img src="img/Workflow.png" alt="Reproducible Work Flow" height=450 width=700 />](img/Workflow.png)

## <i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> Example (Truncated) Workflow

This lecture is created using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It
allows me to create both PDF and HTML slides.

![Lecture file structure](img/RMDLectureFiles.png)

## <i class="fa fa-bookmark-o"></i> Practical Tips for Reproducible Research

- <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i> Document Everything!

- <i class="fa fa-file-code-o"></i> Everything is a (text) file.

- <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> All files should be human readable.

- <i class="fa fa-link"></i> Explicitly tie your files together.

- <i class="fa fa-list-ol"></i> Have a plan to organise, store, and make your files available.

## <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Course Prerequisites

- **Introductory-level statistics**

    + Basic descriptive statistics (e.g. data types, ways of describing distributions)

    + Basic inferential statistics: (significance testing, linear regression)

    + Exposure to statistics software (e.g. SPSS, STATA)

- Knowledge of particular software or computer programming is **not expected**
